    "# Deep Q-Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, Google DeepMind published a new RL algorithm called Deep Q-Network that allowed them to play many Atari Games at a superhuman level for the first time. Although this algorithm was outdated just two years later, it is still quite fast and efficient thanks to several improvements, and we will see a simple implementation in this notebook.\n",

    "## The basis : Q-Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The DQN algorithm is based on the previously developed Q-Network algorithm. I won't explain it in details in this notebook but the principle is to have a neural networks that learn the Q-value of a state-action pair (if you want to refresh your memory, you can read https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0).\n"
