# Deep-RL-agents

Collection of Deep RL agents

# TODO

Model.py: create function that instantiates a model from a list of parameters (instead of having it hard-coded).

New file: write a very (very) short walkthrough through the files (main -> model -> Qnetwork -> agent -> environment).
New file: define the architecture of a super-rainbow (discrete actions) with switches and super-DDPG (continuous actions) with switches.

New files: benchmarks for CPU/GPU tests.
